            <h1>Mahalia Thomas</h1>
            <h2>M.A. Candidate at New York University</h2>

            <p>I'm Mahalia, a current student at New York University focusing on Comparative Politics. As an undergraduate, I was primarily interested in American politics with minors in sociology and public policy. </p>
            <p>My research focus has since shifted towards comparative constitutional law and its implications on electoral politics. Current research seeks to explain the rise of global populism within a constitutional framework starting with Germany's 2017 election.</p>
